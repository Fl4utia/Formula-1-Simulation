# Formula-1-Simulation
Curve section of a new Formula 1 track for the Suzuka GP track in Japan. The objective is to ensure the safety of spectators while providing optimal visibility from the grandstand. To meet these requirements, I have developed a simulation of a car's movement entering the curve zone, illustrating two possible scenarios: the car exiting the track in the event of an accident and the normal trajectory of the car without any incidents.
